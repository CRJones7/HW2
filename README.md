Homework #2
This project is a responsive portolio. 
It inludes html and css styling to create an About me, Contact, and Portfolio page.

A navbar allows you to navigate from one page to the next.


Bootstrap and Bootswatch was used for styling along with a unique css document.

*Images included in Responsive Portfolio are only stock images and placeholds until content is prepared.
*Name Header on navbar and footer reflect the creator of the pages.
